# Neshny
Neshny is an OpenGL/C++ library for games and simulations. It is designed to be unobtrusive - use as little or as much of it as you wish. 

Currently it has dependencies on Qt >= v5.15, Dear ImGui >= v1.88, and Metastuff.

## Installation
*This is a work in progress - later on there will be example projects and cmake files.*

Clone this repo and point to the base dir in your include directories list. Then add
```
// put this in your headers
#include <IncludeAll.h> // Neshny
// put this in your main.cpp or similar
#include <IncludeAll.cpp> // Neshny
```
Currently it assumes you already have QT, ImGui and Metastuff installed.
